# Neuro

Timed Trivia app, with a variety of question topics, selectable number of questions and formats (mc or t/f)

- Built with **React** and **Typescript**.
- Fetches data from the **Open Trivia Database API** using **Axios** to generate the questions.
- Implements state management using **Redux**, to manage 5 features including the form, quiz area, timer, leave modal, and app pages.

## Future Improvements:

- Use **React Query** to fetch data from the API.
- Feature to save previous quizzes in local storage so that they can be accessed later.
